# Project Brief

## What This Is

OSHA_Leads is an intelligence + alerting system for operational teams.

- No legal advice. We provide monitoring, summaries, and operational heads-ups only.
- Business contacts only. No personal/sensitive enrichment.

## Current Priority: Outbound Concierge (Growth Engine)

The current growth engine is an “outbound concierge” motion:

- Build weekly geo-targeted prospect batches (e.g., `TX_W2`)
- Export a mail-merge CSV (subject/body + opt-out link) for external sending
- Process replies manually (then feed suppression updates back into the system)

Weekly target (initial): **100–200 new prospects/week**.

Success metric (funnel): **reply -> call -> paid** (track conversion per batch).

## Compliance & Invariants

- All outreach exports must include an opt-out mechanism.
- Suppression must be enforced for all exports and sends (email and, where available, domain).
