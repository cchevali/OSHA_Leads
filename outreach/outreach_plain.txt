Hi FIRST_NAME,

I run MicroFlowOps. We track recent OSHA inspection activity and send concise, plain-English heads-ups to safety and ops teams in STATE.

Recent signals:
RECENT_SIGNALS_LINES

Last refresh: LAST_REFRESH_ET

If you'd like a sample digest, reply "yes" and I'll send one.

Notes:
- Accident, Complaint, and Referral describe OSHA activity signals (not citations).
- Informational only; not legal advice.

Thanks,
