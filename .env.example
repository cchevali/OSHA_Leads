# For production: use domain mailbox like alerts@yourdomain.com
SMTP_HOST=smtppro.zoho.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=alerts@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password

# Email Addresses
# FROM_EMAIL must match SMTP_USER for deliverability (SPF/DKIM alignment)
FROM_EMAIL=alerts@yourdomain.com
REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@microflowops.com

ALLOW_FROM_MISMATCH=false

# --- Zoho Alias Mode ---
# If Zoho license limits prevent adding a new user (alerts@yourdomain.com),
# use alias sending instead:
#   1. In Zoho Admin > Mail > User > Aliases, add alerts@yourdomain.com
#   2. Optionally set it as the "default Mailbox Address"
#   3. Keep SMTP_USER as the login (existing user), set FROM_EMAIL to the alias
#   4. Add the alias to FROM_ALLOWED_ALIASES:
# FROM_ALLOWED_ALIASES=alerts@yourdomain.com
#
# If alias is promoted to primary: set both SMTP_USER and FROM_EMAIL to the alias.

# Kill switch - set to true to enable live sending
# Default false to prevent accidental sends during domain warmup
